In this program, we start by defining a variable number to hold the input number. We then use cout to display a prompt asking the user to enter a number. We use cin to read in the user's input and store it in the number variable.

We then check whether the number is even or odd using the modulus operator (%). If the remainder of number divided by 2 is 0, then number is even, and we use cout to display a message indicating that. If the remainder is not 0, then number is odd, and we display a different message.

Finally, we return 0 to indicate that the program has executed successfully.
